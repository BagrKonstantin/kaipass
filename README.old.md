# KaiPass
## Problem & Market size
According to *Washington post* 
62 percent of people suffered from boredom during the lock down.
Narrowing it down to the number of active internet users we 
get 0,5 billion people. Being bored can affect your mental
health and that is the problem we solve.

## Solution
KaiPass is based on the principles from Kaizen¹ theory
merged with popular nowadays promotion model "Battle pass²".
KaiPass will not only entertain you but also will
help to improve many aspects of your life

1.Kaizen is Japanese for “change for better”
2.Battle pass is a type of monetization approach rewarding
the player with in-game items for playing the game and 
completing specific challenges

## How does it work
Everything is pretty simple.
Every user has daily, weekly and monthly tasks which are divided into
different categories and directed to improve different 
aspects of life. Every challenge taken upgrades KaiPass level and gives
awards for your profile customization.
But this idea is not fun without the competition. You can track 
your friends' progress and try to beat them.
Also there is an achievement system that will show to your friends 
your successes in sports, education, Etc.
This should encourage you to daily improve yourself with Kaizen principles. 
Every day you will get closer to the goal you set.

To the moment frontend is ready for eighty percent but we have troubles
with backend especially with data base(there is no data base) cause our teammate got sick)(

## Plans for future
Stay turned - we have many great ideas how to develop our project:
- we are working on mobile app
- we are going to add awards and subscriptions for
thematic services
